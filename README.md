# First-dashboard
Hey, I’m Sourav Saha Anik. An undergraduate student from Gopalganj Science and Technology University. Currently, I am learning data analysis, where I have found good opportunities. This is the first dashboard work I have officially uploaded as a portfolio. 

# Data Analysis with Power BI & Tableau
This is the visualizations, and screenshots where I analyzed a local business dataset using Power BI and the Global Store Dataset using Tableau.

# Power BI Project
This is data on local market sales, where I tried to show the sales performance of the 4 groups. The groups launched 3 campaigns, which worked successfully and increased sales. Also, the discount on the product helped to raise the sales. All 4 groups are managed to sell $200k+ each, and the use of the multi-model payment method was a huge success, which helped to increase the sales.

# Tableau Project
This is a global sales project, which shows the sales performance across the U.S.A. It shows the major cities like New York, which made a great sale. Some other states also did well. According to the graph, the sales have remained stable through the years.
